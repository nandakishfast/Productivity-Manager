# PRODUCTIVITY MANAGER

Productivity Manager is a desktop application written in python, with tkinter for the front-end UI and sqlite for the backend. It can be used by anyone to take their productivity to the next level. It is a self 
improvemt software that runs locally and has features to provide insights to the users about their performance
throughout the day, using which one can improve themselves.



## Features

- **Supports multiple users**
If many people use the same system, they can create different accounts and use it seamlessly 
- **Create custom activities and give points for them based on importance**
If you want meditate, you can add an activity *Meditation for 5 mins*, and give 50pts for that activity.
- **Activities classified under 4 categories**
Competitive Programming, Fitness, Knowledge, Mind (Build by a CSE student 😅)
- **Article, Word, and Book Follow-up**
According to the Forgetting Curve hypothesis, within one hour, people will have forgotten an average of 50 percent of the information you presented. Within 24 hours, they have forgotten an average of 70 percent of new information, and within a week, forgetting claims an average of 90 percent of it.

This Feature aims to resolve the above problem by prompting the user to have a look at the article read, word learnt, and a page read from book again. This helps in retaining what one has learnt.

User is prompted to have a follow up after 1day, 3days, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and following which he/she is reminded to have follow up each year.

At any point if the user wants to stop getting follow ups on a particular activity, he/she can do so.

- **Flexibility in view levels for user to compare his/her performance**
Users can see his performance on each day, or dive deep by looking at performance at each hour, or even choose their own time period to self-evalute and improve.

For example, an user can see her daily performance points and try to get more points than yesterday and there by accelerate growth.
They can also see hourly performance to gain insights about their most productive hours and also least productive hours, using which, they can improve on the latter. The user can also to see what he/she did from 6PM - 10PM on a particular day using the custom window feature.

- **Graph based user performance reports**
- **Leaderboard to display top performing users**
